If you want to download and install the official version of Windows 8.1, you can use the tools on this page[^1^] [^2^] to create your own installation media using either a USB flash drive or a DVD. Before you begin, make sure you have:
 
- An internet connection (internet service provider fees may apply).
- Sufficient data storage available on a computer, USB or external drive for the download.
- A blank USB or DVD (and DVD burner) with at least 4 GB of space if you want to create media. We recommend using a blank USB or blank DVD, because any content on it will be deleted.
- Your Windows product key (xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx). If you will be installing the operating system for the first time, you will need your Windows product key. For more information about product keys and when they are required, visit this page[^3^].

After you have prepared everything, follow these steps:

1. Download the media creation tool (aprx. 1.41MB) from this page[^1^]. This tool provides the best download experience for customers running Windows 7, 8.1 and 10. Tool includes:
    - File formats optimized for download speed.
    - Built in media creation options for USBs and DVDs.
    - Optional conversion to ISO file format.
2. Run the tool and follow the instructions on the screen. You will be asked to select the edition, language, and architecture (32-bit or 64-bit) of Windows 8.1 that you want to download.
3. Choose whether you want to create a USB flash drive or an ISO file that you can burn to a DVD later.
4. Select the location where you want to save the installation media.
5. Wait for the download and creation process to finish.
6. If you chose to create a USB flash drive, you can now use it to install Windows 8.1 on your computer. If you chose to create an ISO file, you will need to burn it to a DVD using a third-party tool such as this one.
7. To install Windows 8.1 from the installation media, insert it into your computer and restart it. You may need to change the boot order in your BIOS settings to boot from the USB or DVD. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation.
